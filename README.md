## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is an online bookstore application built using Nest.js, and PostgreSQL for database management. It provides an API for managing books, authors, publishers, translators, and categories. Additionally, users can submit reviews for books, apply discount codes, and complete purchases via the Zarinpal payment gateway. The app is integrated with AWS for image management and uses Swagger for API documentation.
